# SAP HR Transformation — Knowledge Library

A practitioner's reference library for SAP HR Transformation programmes, covering the end-to-end **Hire-to-Retire (H2R)** business process. The library is organized into four pillars: **Solution Architecture**, **Technical Strategy**, **SAP Services** (cloud platform, integration, identity, and operations), and **SAP HR Transformation** (on-premise ECC/S4 HCM core configuration). Each section contains architecture decisions, configuration guides, and step-by-step screenshots built from real project experience.

## What This Library Covers

This repository is a living knowledge base for SAP integration architects, BTP engineers, and HCM functional consultants. It spans both ends of an H2R landscape: the cloud-side strategy, governance, and integration layer (BTP, Integration Suite, IAS/IPS) and the on-premise core — building and configuring SAP ECC/S4 HCM from the ground up (Enterprise Structure, Personnel Structure, Organizational Management, Payroll, and Time Management).

## 01 Solution Architecture

The Solution Architecture caters to the overall solution of the HR Transformation proejct like Deployment Strategy, Roll out approach, SF Instance Strategy, IDentity and Authentication strategy, Refresh strategy, Testing strategy, Payroll process strategy, Roll out strategyetc


---
## 02 Technical Strategy

The strategy layer defines **what** to build and **why** — before a single iFlow is written or a subaccount created.

### Integration Principles & Methodology

Governing principles applied across all H2R integration scenarios:

- **Seamless Integrations** — design integrations that support effortless business process execution without friction
- **Reusability** — abstract integration patterns as accelerators for future scenarios; favour modular iFlow design to lower Total Cost of Ownership
- **API-First** — prioritise OData and REST APIs over IDocs or file-based transfers wherever possible
- **Modernisation** — enforce current security standards: OAuth 2.0 for all SuccessFactors communication, TLS 1.2+ everywhere, and no Basic Auth in production
- **Holistic Integration** — cover all integration domains: Process, Data, Event-based, and AI-driven
- **Best Practices** — follow SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology (ISA-M) as the design framework

### Cloud Integration Strategy & Governance

Governance is not optional in an H2R landscape — employee data is subject to GDPR and data residency requirements. The governance framework operates across four dimensions:

| Dimension | Scope |
|---|---|
| **Landscape Strategy** | BTP account topology: Global Account → Directories → Subaccounts by workstream and environment |
| **Security Strategy** | Authentication (OAuth 2.0, SAML 2.0, Client Certificates), API Management as a mandatory gateway for inbound traffic, PII masking in message logs |
| **Onboarding Strategy** | Documented team onboarding process; RBAC role collections for all BTP services; no ad-hoc access grants |
| **Cost Management** | Consumption-based CPEA model; entitlement buffers maintained at Global Account level; per-subaccount service catalogues |

Key governance rules enforced across all H2R BTP subaccounts:

- Every Global Account must have a minimum of **2 Administrators** (prevents admin lockout)
- Every service subscription must have a minimum of **2 Role Collections** assigned
- A Global Services Catalogue and per-subaccount Local Services Catalogue must be maintained
- All user access is granted via a documented User Onboarding process — no exceptions
- Naming conventions enforced for subaccounts, subdomains, iFlows, security credentials, and CF Spaces

### BTP Infrastructure Management

Infrastructure management covers the operational lifecycle of the BTP platform:

- **BTP Structuring** — Subaccount topology design, entitlement and quota management, and IaaS tooling (Terraform for infrastructure-as-code)
- **DevOps & Release Management** — cTMS for controlled transport of Integration Suite artifacts across DEV → QA → PRD; GitHub for version control and backup of iFlow content packages
- **Operations** — Cloud ALM for real-time monitoring of integration errors and proactive alerting
- **Audit Logging** — All BTP audit logs routed from the SAP BTP Audit Log Service to enterprise SIEM systems (Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel)
- **Access Control** — IAS as the single, centralised proxy Identity Provider for all BTP subaccounts; Azure AD as the upstream corporate directory

### SSO End-to-End Process

The SSO flow in a modern H2R landscape follows this chain:

```
Employee → Corporate IdP (Azure AD)
         → SAP IAS (Proxy)
         → SAP Application (SuccessFactors, BTP, Build Work Zone)
```

IAS sits at the centre — it acts as a **proxy** between the corporate identity (Azure AD/ADFS) and all SAP applications. This means employees authenticate once with their corporate credentials and access all SAP HR systems without separate logins. The SSO design covers SAML 2.0 federation, OIDC-based flows, and the OAuth 2.0 SAML Bearer Assertion pattern used for SuccessFactors API access.

## 02 SAP Services

Each service document covers architecture, design decisions, procurement/licensing, step-by-step configuration, and common pitfalls.

### SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)

**File:** `02 SAP Services/00 SAP_BTP_Hire_to_Retire.md`

Covers the foundational BTP infrastructure for H2R:

- Global Account structure and Directory hierarchy
- Subaccount design: minimum DEV, QA, PRD separation aligned to the SuccessFactors data centre region
- Entitlement management: Integration Suite plans (Standard vs Enterprise Edition), Connectivity, Destination, XSUAA, IAS, Alert Notification
- Cloud Connector: installation, system mapping, RFC and HTTP resource access control, HA Master-Shadow configuration, and certificate management
- Destination configuration for SuccessFactors OData (OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion), on-premise SAP ERP HCM (RFC via Cloud Connector), and SFTP
- Trust Configuration: step-by-step IAS trust establishment, SAML assertion structure, shadow user creation, and role collection mapping via IAS groups
- Security layers: network (TLS, SCC outbound-only tunnel), application (RBAC, MFA), and data (PGP encryption, message log PII controls)
- Common pitfalls with resolutions: immutable subaccount subdomains, entitlement quota exhaustion, admin lockout, dual-IdP risk

### SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS) & Identity Provisioning Service (IPS)

**File:** `02 SAP Services/01 SAP_IAS_IPS_Hire_to_Retire.md`

**Config Details:** `02 SAP Services/01.1 IAS Config.md`

### SAP Cloud Transport Management (cTMS)

**File:** `02 SAP Services/04 SAP_Transport_Management_Hire_to_Retire.md`

**Config Details:** `02 SAP Services/04.1 TMS Config.md`

Covers controlled promotion of Integration Suite artifacts across landscapes:

- Architecture: cTMS as a central transport orchestration layer between DEV, QA, and PRD Integration Suite tenants
- Transport nodes and transport routes configuration
- Integration Suite export configuration: connecting the Content Agent Service to cTMS
- End-to-end transport workflow: exporting iFlow packages from DEV → transport request in cTMS → import to QA → approval → import to PRD
- Externalised parameters: managing environment-specific values (URLs, credentials) across transport targets without re-configuration
- CI/CD integration: using cTMS APIs in a GitHub Actions pipeline for automated promotion
- Governance: mandatory transport approval gates for PRD imports

### SAP BTP Audit Log & SIEM Integration

**File:** `02 SAP Services/05 SAP_BTP_Audit_Management_SIEM.md`

Covers the audit log architecture and SIEM routing for compliance:

- SAP BTP Audit Log Service: what events are captured (configuration changes, security events, data access)
- Service plans and entitlements: `standard` vs `premium` plan
- Audit Log Viewer: browsing audit logs in the BTP Cockpit
- Audit Log Retrieval API: OAuth-secured API for programmatic log retrieval
- SIEM integration patterns: push (Integration Suite iFlow forwards logs) vs pull (SIEM agent polls the API)
- Step-by-step Splunk integration: HTTP Event Collector (HEC) configuration, index and sourcetype setup, dashboard queries
- Security and compliance considerations: log retention periods, PII handling in audit events, SOC 2 alignment

## 03 SAP HR Transformation

While Strategy and SAP Services cover the cloud-side integration and platform layer, this pillar covers the **on-premise core** — building and configuring SAP ECC / S/4HANA HCM from a blank system through to a working Hire-to-Retire lifecycle, and then extending that core into a hybrid landscape with SAP SuccessFactors. Content is organized into two streams: a phased, stage-by-stage configuration build (`HR Data Migration`) and a topic-by-topic reference library (`SAP HCM`) covering structures, SuccessFactors integration patterns, and migration/replication artifacts.

### HR Data Migration — Phased Configuration Build

**Folder:** `03 SAP HR Transformation/HR Data Migration/`

A stage-by-stage build of a working HCM system, where each stage depends on the one before it:

- **Phase 1 — Organization Set Up (Stages 0–10):** Enterprise Structure, Number Ranges, Payroll Area & Control Record, PINCH & Admin Groups, Pay Scale Structure, Features (TARIF & LGMST), Organizational Management, PA-OM Integration, Personnel Administration, Employee Hiring, Time Management
- **Phase 2 — SF Integration:** Migration, Replication, and Employee Migration Scenarios — extending the on-premise build into a hybrid landscape with SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central

## Key Design Decisions

These are the non-obvious decisions that shape the entire H2R landscape and are documented with rationale in each product file:

**IAS must replace the default SAP ID Service in all production subaccounts.** The default `accounts.sap.com` IdP does not support corporate SSO, MFA enforcement, or new hire activation email workflows.

**API Management is mandatory for all inbound traffic.** Direct calls to Integration Suite without an API Management gateway bypass rate limiting, threat detection, and centralised token validation.

**Cloud Connector HA (Master + Shadow) is required for production.** H2R data replication is business-critical — a single Cloud Connector instance is a single point of failure.

**OAuth 2.0 SAML Bearer Assertion is the required authentication type for all SuccessFactors API connections.** Basic Authentication is deprecated by SAP and must not be used in any production integration.

**All BTP audit logs must be routed to the enterprise SIEM.** BTP subaccount access, configuration changes, and data read events constitute security-relevant audit evidence required for GDPR and SOC 2 compliance.
